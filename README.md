# Instant Health Alert System | Modern Data Engineering AWS Project

## Introduction :
In today's world, technology plays a vital role in every field, and similarly, our healthcare system needs to integrate with it. With the advent of IoT devices that digitize vital health data like heartbeat, blood pressure, body temperature, and more, healthcare monitoring in hospitals has faced new challenges. To address these challenges, this use case proposes a reliable data pipeline solution to store and analyze a stream of real-time data flowing from various IoT devices in hospitals and health centers. Capturing and analyzing this high-velocity stream of data in real-time with minimal error is only possible through a robust data platform and components.

## Technology Used :
1. Programming Language : Python
2. Scripting Language : SQL
3. Amazon Web Services :
    - Apache Sqoop
    - Apache Pyspark
    - Apache Kafka
    - Apache Hive
    - Apache Hbase
4. Amazon SNS Service

## Dataset used :
All The data of our project will be hosted in a Centralised RDS from which we import the data. here we have 3 tables in this RDS, patient's vital info, patient_information, threshold Reference table.
1. Patient's Vital Info : have the data of IoT device which is customerId, heartbeat, bp and other details are.

    The details for this table in RDS are as follows:
    - Hostname: upgraddetest.cyaielc9bmnf.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com
    - username: student
    - password: STUDENT123
    - dbname: testdatabase
    - table-name: patients_vital_info
  
2. Patient Information : This table have the data of patients like, patientId, patientname, patientaddress, phone_number, admitted_ward, other_details.

   The details for this table in RDS are as follows:
    - Hostname: upgraddetest.cyaielc9bmnf.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com
    - username: student
    - password: STUDENT123
    - dbname: testdatabase
    - table-name: patients_information
  
3. Threshold Reference Table : This table have the data of attributes like heartbeat, bp etc with its higher and lower limits. data like attribute, Low_age_limit, high_age_limit, low_value, high_value, alert_flag, alert_message. we create this table manually in Hbase

## Task we performed in this project :
In this project, all the data is hosted in a centralized RDS containing three tables: patients_vital_info, patients_contact, and Threshold_Reference_table.

The first table, patients_vital_info, receives high-velocity data from IoT devices every second. Our initial task is to extract this data from RDS and load it into a designated           location for further analysis.

The second table, patients_contact, holds information about each patient, including their ID, name, address, etc. This data is updated on a daily or weekly basis, making it a form        of batch data that can also be extracted from RDS and transferred to another location for further analysis.

Lastly, the Threshold_Reference_table contains the upper and lower limits for the patients_vital_info data. We use this table to compare and identify any attributes that fall             outside the defined thresholds. If any attribute is detected as out of range, the system immediately sends an email alert to doctors, including the patientâ€™s name, phone number,          address, and the attribute that is out of range.

Our entire project is divided into three phases, which I will explain one by one.
