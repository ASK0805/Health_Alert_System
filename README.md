# INSTANT HEALTH ALERT SYSTEM

## Introduction :
In today's world, technology plays a vital role in every field, and similarly, our healthcare system needs to integrate with it. With the advent of IoT devices that digitize vital health data like heartbeat, blood pressure, body temperature, and more, healthcare monitoring in hospitals has faced new challenges. To address these challenges, this use case proposes a reliable data pipeline solution to store and analyze a stream of real-time data flowing from various IoT devices in hospitals and health centers. Capturing and analyzing this high-velocity stream of data in real-time with minimal error is only possible through a robust data platform and components.
